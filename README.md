(Smart Canteen Management System)
<br>
This project is designed to simplify the food ordering process inside college canteens. It allows students and faculty to order meals digitally, while staff manage orders efficiently from their panel. The goal is to reduce wait time, improve communication, and make the process faster and more organized.
