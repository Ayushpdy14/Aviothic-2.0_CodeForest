(Smart Canteen Management System)
<br>
<br>
**This project is designed to simplify the food ordering process inside college canteens. It allows students and faculty to order meals digitally, while staff manage orders efficiently from their panel. The goal is to reduce wait time, improve communication, and make the process faster and more organized.**
<br>
<br>
**Problem Addressed:**
<br>
Canteen queues are long, orders get mixed up, and payments take time.
<br>
Students and staff waste valuable time managing and waiting for food orders.
<br>
**Proposed Solution:**
<br>
A digital canteen management system where users can order online, choose payment mode, and track order status.
<br>
Staff receive orders instantly and update progress in real time reducing confusion, saving time, and improving efficiency.
